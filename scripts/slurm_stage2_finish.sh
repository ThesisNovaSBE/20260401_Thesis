# Runs only the post-training steps against the ALREADY fine-tuned model at
# models/stage2_longformer_best -- deliberately does NOT call train_stage2()
# / setup_stage2.py, since resubmitting the full pipeline would resume from
# the last checkpoint and continue training past where early stopping
# already correctly stopped it (confirmed 2026-09-06: it stopped ~epoch 1.02
# because validation AUPRC had already peaked and started declining --
# resuming would just keep degrading it, not improve it).
#
# This exists because calibrate.py was found reusing a stale calibration
# file from before the model was retrained (fixed 2026-09-08, see
# src/stage2/calibrate.py's fingerprint check) -- --force here guarantees a
# fresh calibration regardless of that fingerprint file's state.
